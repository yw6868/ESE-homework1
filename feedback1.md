## Problem 1 (3/5)

You may misunderstand the flowchart, the right branch or the left `b>c` is pointing to `a>c`, so the output of the flowchart should always be decreasing order.

## Problem 2 (5/10)

1. `c(0:50)` will generate totally `51` numbers from `0` to `50`, and the numbers are in increasing order.  According to the description of the problem, you should use `runif(50,0,50)`

2. After you get the answer, you should verified the result with `%*%` operator.

## Problem 3 (9/10)

The code is right, but you are asked to print the $k^{th}$ line of the Pascal Triangle, and you are asked to report `Pascal_triangle(100)` and `Pascal_triangle(200)`

## Problem 5 (20/20)

## Problem 6 (25/25)
